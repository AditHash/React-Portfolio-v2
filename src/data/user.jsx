My deep interest in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning has led me to work on diverse projects involving supervised and unsupervised learning, deep neural networks, natural language processing, and most recently, Generative AI. I enjoy exploring the intersection of backend development and intelligent systems—where automation meets creativity and problem-solving becomes both technical and strategic.\n \n "+
